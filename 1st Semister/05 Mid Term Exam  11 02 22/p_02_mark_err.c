#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

    /**
        char s = "america"

        In C statement the problem is
            1. you need to use s as array like
                => char s[]= "america"
            2. you have to put a semicolon at the end of line like
                => char s[]= "america";
    */
    char s[] = "america";

    return 0;
}
